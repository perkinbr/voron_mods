# Trident USB Bed Cam
This webcam mount is designed to go next to the bed, with the USB cable snaking through the Z chain.
Seems to work OK.  Comments and critism welcome.

I picked up the cheapest webcam I could find on Amazon.
This is a little bit of a crapshoot as there's wide variety of cameras, but my experience (N=2) is that you can cut them open pretty easily and cut them apart.
The one I got this time happened to have manual focus and a USB connector on the PCB which made hooking things up much eaiser (otherwise I think I'd have had to do some soldering since a standardusb connector wouldn't be possible to thread through the cable chain.
Since each webcam seems to have a different PCB, you will likely have to modify the bracket to get it fit for yours.
